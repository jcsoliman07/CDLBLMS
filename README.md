## 📌 About the Project

**CDLBLMS** stands for **Colegio de Los Banos Library Management System**.  
This project is designed to simplify and automate the daily operations of a school's library. It allows librarians to manage book records, borrowing logs, and user accounts while giving students a platform to browse and request books online.

The system is developed as a **solo project** to demonstrate strong fundamentals in PHP, MySQL, and front-end technologies like Bootstrap and jQuery.
